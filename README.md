## Pillars Of Csharp 
**Object Oriented Programming practice in C#**

Branches 1 - 3: Classes, Objects and Constructor

Branches 4 - 6: [Inheritance](https://www.guru99.com/c-sharp-inheritance-polymorphism.html)

Inheritance is an important concept in C#. Inheritance is a concept in which you define parent classes and child 
classes. The child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class, but at the same time, they can also 
modify the behavior of the methods if required. The child class can also define methods of its own if required.

Branches 7 - 10: [Polymorphism](https://www.tutlane.com/tutorial/csharp/csharp-polymorphism)

In c#, polymorphism provides an ability for the classes to implement different methods that are called 
through the same name and it also provides an ability to invoke the methods of a derived class through 
base class reference during runtime based on our requirements.

Branches 11: [Encapsulation](https://www.tutlane.com/tutorial/csharp/csharp-encapsulation)

In c#, Encapsulation is a process of binding the variables and method/functions into a single unit.   
Generally, encapsulation is used to prevent alteration of code (data) accidentally from the outside of functions.  
In c#, by defining the class fields with properties we can protect the data from accidental corruption.
